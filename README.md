## swiftui-examples

A growing collection of pretty SwiftUI code snippets to use in your projects based on code from my projects.

Most examples are focused on having a great UX.

Feel free to star the repo, many more examples to come :)

### Playful, squishy play button

This button toggles between play and pause and is a squishy button that changes its shape when pressed. It uses a combination of animations and symbol effects to achieve a playful look.
