A growing collection of pretty SwiftUI code snippets to use in your projects based on code from my projects.

Most examples are focused on having a great UX and add a little bit of fun for the user.

#### [Squishy waveform button](https://github.com/fabiangruss/swiftui-examples/tree/main/waveform_button)


This button handles audio playback (provided as `Data`) and displays an animated waveform when music/voicenotes are playing. Works like this:
- audio data is divided into chunks
- each chunk's average amplitude is converted to decibels to create waveform bars
- these are rendered in SwiftUI
